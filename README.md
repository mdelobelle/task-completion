# Tasks Completion

Includes an inline tasks toggler for custom statusses
e.g.

- [ ] some task that can be partially completed ⏮️ ⏩

when clicked ⏩ the task changes to

- [1] some task that can be partially completed ⏮️ ⏩

values in brackets can be customized depending on task type (tbd how to define a task type... maybe depending on the tags of the file ?)
